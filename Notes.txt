#### Sequence of instructions to setup a new run (climatological
forcing, Benguela):
-------------------------------------------------

# Initial file edits:
- Edit the name in setup_new_config.sh and run it to create a clean
  directory.
- Edit cppdefs.h with required options (e.g. name, MPI, BULK_FLUX, etc.).
- Edit croco.in for time-step, length, input and output file names and
  all sort of other settings.
- Edit crocotools_param.m for input files setup (grid res, paths to
  src directories etc).
- Edit param.h for pre-compilation parameters (grid sizes, MPI sizes
  etc.)
- Edit start.m for paths.
- Edit submit_croco.sub for PBS submission parameters.

# Pre-processing:
start matlab (you can use ../matlab_load.sh)

start
make_grid:
        to make INPUT/croco_grd.nc
make_bulk:
        to make bulk forcing atmospheric forcing, could also do
        make_forcing for flux forcing, makes INPUT/croco_blk.nc)

make_bry:
        to make boundary forcing files. Can also do make_clim to have
        climatological nuding files that nudge into the interior. Note
        that for WOA13 based climatology boundary conditions you need
        to do make_forcing first in order to create wind stress inputs
        to use in the geostrophic (/Ekman?) calculation of velocity
        boundary conditions from T/S. Creates croco_bry.nc and
        croco_bry_Z.nc

make_ini:
        to make the initial conditions.

# Compilation:
Edit jobcomp if needed (shouldn't be needed).
To compile, do (creates croco executable):
./jobcomp > jobcomp.log

# To run:
qsub submit_croco.sub

output turns up in OUTPUT. The log is in OUTPUT/croco.out
